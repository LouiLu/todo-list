#### Testing - did not implemented

To be honest, I am not very confident with my unit testing skills. I did setup some realy simple unit testing, but since I am lacking of testing experience, I don't want to show you guys some "entry-level"/"Crude" testing code at this moment. But for sure, I will keep on learning testing and treat testing as a very important aspect in developments!
